#  Welcome to InRhythm's SwiftUI Propel Workshop

## For the first excercise we want to build a login page using what we have learned so far in SwiftUI

The purpose of this workshop is to understand what are the best practices & where are some of the gaps in SwiftUI.  It will be an interactive session for formulating ideas and do knowledge transfer to enhance our team's understanding of the SwiftUI fundamentals. 

## Phase 1

The purpose of the phase 1 exercise is not to have a finished product but rather to learn and experiment with SwiftUI technologies.    

### Steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a branch
3. Name the branch <FirstNameLastName>SwiftUIWorkshop
4. Pull branch into XCode and get to work

You can add comments in areas where it is valuable for discussions / demo

(See included phase 1 image)

## Phase 2

After learning about SwiftUI Navigation we want to implement 

Navigate from the 'Login Page' to a new View while passing the login username using (but not limited to) one of the following options in SwiftUI:
-    NavigationLink or NavigationStack
